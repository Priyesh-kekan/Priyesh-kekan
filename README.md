# Hi 👋, I'm Priyesh Kekan

🎮 **Game Developer | Unity | C#**  
💻 **Frontend Developer | React.js**

I am a dedicated game developer with strong hands-on experience in designing and building interactive games using **Unity and C#**. My primary focus is on creating smooth player mechanics, engaging combat systems, intelligent enemy behavior, and polished gameplay experiences. I enjoy working across the full game development pipeline—from gameplay programming and physics simulation to UI integration and performance optimization.

Alongside game development, I have a solid background in **frontend web development**, which allows me to build clean, responsive user interfaces and understand user-centric design principles. This cross-domain experience helps me create games with better usability, visual consistency, and system structure.
